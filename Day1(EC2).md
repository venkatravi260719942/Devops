## 1. Greeting/Welcome (2-3 minutes)
- “Hi, everyone! Today’s class will be exploration of EC2, where we will go deeper into the various aspects of EC2 and how you can use it effectively.”

  - “We will be touched on the basics of EC2, like launching instances, instance types, and key concepts. And we’ll dive deeper into advanced topics such as instance storage, pricing models, security, and how to manage your EC2 instances.”


# Day 1: AWS EC2 - Launching Instances, Instance Types, and Key Concepts

## 1. Launching EC2 Instances
Launching an EC2 instance in AWS is straightforward. Here’s how to launch an instance:

### Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console
- Log in with your AWS credentials.
- Navigate to the **EC2** service from the "Services" dropdown or search for it.

### Step 2: Launch Instance
- Click **"Launch Instance"** to start the instance creation wizard.
- Key configurations include:
  1. **AMI (Amazon Machine Image):**
     - Choose an AMI, which is a pre-configured template that includes the OS (e.g., Amazon Linux 2, Ubuntu, Windows Server).
  2. **Instance Type:**
     - Select the hardware configuration (CPU, memory) for the instance.
  3. **Key Pair:**
     - Create or use an existing key pair to securely SSH into your instance.
     - Download the private key file (`.pem`).
  4. **Security Group:**
     - Create or select a security group to control traffic.
     - Common rules: Allow SSH (port 22) or RDP (port 3389).

### Step 3: Configure Instance Details
- Set up details like:
  - Number of instances.
  - VPC and Subnet.
  - Auto-assign public IP if needed.

### Step 4: Add Storage
- Choose storage options like EBS volumes (you can increase storage size or add additional volumes).

### Step 5: Tag Instance
- Add tags for organizing resources (e.g., `Name: WebServer`).

### Step 6: Review and Launch
- Review configurations and click **"Launch"**.

### Step 7: Connect to the Instance
- Once running, connect to the instance:
  - **Linux:** `ssh -i /path_to_your_key.pem ec2-user@public_ip_of_instance`.
  - **Windows:** Use an RDP client and the public IP.

## 2. EC2 Instance Types
When launching an EC2 instance, choose an **instance type** based on your workload. AWS offers several categories of instance types:

### A. General Purpose
- **T-Series** (e.g., T3, T4g): Low-cost, burstable workloads.
  - **Use Case:** Web servers, development environments.
- **M-Series** (e.g., M5, M6g): Balanced between CPU, memory, and networking.
  - **Use Case:** Databases, backend servers.

### B. Compute Optimized
- **C-Series** (e.g., C5, C6g): Optimized for compute-intensive tasks.
  - **Use Case:** Machine learning, high-performance computing.

### C. Memory Optimized
- **R-Series** (e.g., R5, R6g): Large amounts of RAM.
  - **Use Case:** High-performance databases, big data processing.
- **X-Series** (e.g., X1, X2g): For memory-intensive applications.
  - **Use Case:** SAP HANA, real-time analytics.

### D. Storage Optimized
- **I-Series** (e.g., I3, I4i): High-speed storage.
  - **Use Case:** NoSQL databases, data warehousing.
- **D-Series** (e.g., D2, D3): High disk throughput.
  - **Use Case:** File servers, distributed computing.

### E. GPU Optimized
- **P-Series** (e.g., P3, P4): For GPU-based computing tasks.
  - **Use Case:** Deep learning, video rendering.
- **G-Series** (e.g., G4, G5): Graphics-intensive applications.
  - **Use Case:** Game streaming, 3D rendering.

## 3. Key Concepts in EC2

### A. AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
- **What it is:** A pre-configured template containing the OS and software.
- **Use Case:** Select a pre-built AMI or create a custom one for your use case.

### B. Security Groups
- **What it is:** Acts as a virtual firewall controlling traffic to/from the instance.
- **Use Case:** Control access to instances (e.g., allow SSH for Linux, HTTP for web apps).

### C. Key Pairs
- **What it is:** Used for secure access to EC2 instances via SSH or RDP.
- **Use Case:** Keep the private key safe to log in to instances securely.

### D. Elastic IP
- **What it is:** A static public IP address that can be associated with an EC2 instance.
- **Use Case:** When you need a fixed public IP, even if the instance is stopped or restarted.

### E. Auto Scaling
- **What it is:** Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand.
- **Use Case:** Scale up during high demand and scale down when traffic decreases.

### F. Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)
- **What it is:** Distributes traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- **Use Case:** Ensures high availability by balancing the load across healthy instances.

### G. EBS (Elastic Block Store)
- **What it is:** Persistent block-level storage volumes attached to EC2 instances.
- **Use Case:** Store data persistently even if the instance is stopped or terminated.
