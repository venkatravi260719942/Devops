# Day 14: GitHub

## 1. Introduction to GitHub

### What is GitHub?
**GitHub** is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories. It offers collaborative features such as pull requests, issue tracking, and project management tools. GitHub integrates with Git to help developers work together on projects.

### Key Concepts:
- **Repositories**: Git repositories hosted on GitHub. They can be public or private.
- **Forks**: Copies of a repository that allow you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.
- **Pull Requests**: Requests to merge changes from one branch or fork into another, often used for code review and collaboration.
- **Issues**: Tracking tasks, bugs, or enhancements related to a project.
- **Actions**: CI/CD workflows for automating tasks such as building, testing, and deploying code.

1. **Create a Repository**:
   - After logging in, click the **+** icon in the top right corner and select **New repository**.
   - Enter a **Repository name**, optionally provide a **description**, and choose to make it **Public** or **Private**.
   - Optionally initialize the repository with a **README**, **.gitignore**, or **license**.
   - Click **Create repository**.

### C. Cloning a Repository
1. **Clone Repository**:
   - On the repository page, click **Code** and copy the repository URL.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine:

## 3. Working with GitHub

### A. Creating a Branch
1. **Create and Switch Branch**:
   - In the repository, go to the **Branch** dropdown and type a new branch name.
   - Click **Create branch**.

### B. Making Changes
1. **Edit Files**:
   - Use GitHub’s online editor to make changes to files directly in the repository.

2. **Commit Changes**:
   - After editing, click **Commit changes**, provide a commit message, and optionally add a description.

### C. Pull Requests
1. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Navigate to the **Pull Requests** tab and click **New pull request**.
   - Select the base branch and compare branch, then click **Create pull request**.
   - Provide a title and description, then click **Create pull request**.

2. **Review and Merge**:
   - Review the pull request, discuss changes with collaborators, and resolve conflicts if any.
   - Click **Merge pull request** to merge the changes into the base branch.

### D. Issues
1. **Create an Issue**:
   - Go to the **Issues** tab and click **New issue**.
   - Provide a title and description, then click **Submit new issue**.

2. **Manage Issues**:
   - View, comment on, and close issues as necessary.
   - Use labels, milestones, and assignments to organize and track issues.

## 4. Collaborating on GitHub

### A. Forking a Repository
1. **Fork a Repo**:
   - Navigate to the repository you want to fork.
   - Click **Fork** in the top right corner to create a copy of the repository under your account.

### B. Making Contributions
1. **Clone Your Fork**:
   - Clone your forked repository to your local machine.

2. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Make changes in your local fork and push them to GitHub.
   - Create a pull request from your fork to the original repository.

### C. GitHub Actions
1. **Set Up Actions**:
   - Go to the **Actions** tab of your repository.
   - Click **New workflow** to create and configure CI/CD workflows using YAML files.

2. **Monitor Workflows**:
   - View the status and logs of your workflows in the **Actions** tab.

## 5. Best Practices for Using GitHub

### A. Commit Messages
- **Be Descriptive**: Write clear, concise commit messages that explain the purpose of the changes.
- **Format**: Use a standard format such as a short summary followed by a detailed description if necessary.

### B. Branching Strategy
- **Feature Branches**: Create branches for new features or bug fixes.
- **Main Branch**: Keep the main branch stable and deployable.

### C. Collaboration
- **Code Reviews**: Use pull requests for code reviews and discussions before merging changes.
- **Issue Tracking**: Use issues to track tasks, bugs, and enhancements.

### D. Security
- **Manage Permissions**: Control access to repositories using teams and roles.
- **Keep Dependencies Updated**: Regularly update dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.
