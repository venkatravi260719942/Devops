# Day 21: Prometheus, Grafana, and Node Exporter

## 1. Introduction to Prometheus

### What is Prometheus?
**Prometheus** is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It is used to monitor systems, collect metrics, and trigger alerts based on defined conditions.

### Key Features:
- **Time-Series Database**: Stores metrics data with timestamps.
- **Pull Model**: Prometheus scrapes targets to collect metrics, as opposed to receiving pushed data.
- **PromQL**: Query language used to retrieve and manipulate time-series data.
- **Alerting**: Integrated alert manager for sending notifications when certain conditions are met.

## 2. Introduction to Grafana

### What is Grafana?
**Grafana** is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It provides powerful dashboards and visualization tools for understanding and analyzing metrics.

### Key Features:
- **Visualization**: Create interactive and flexible dashboards with a wide range of charts and graphs.
- **Integration with Prometheus**: Seamlessly integrates with Prometheus to visualize collected metrics.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts based on visualized data.

## 3. Introduction to Node Exporter

### What is Node Exporter?
**Node Exporter** is a Prometheus exporter that exposes hardware and operating system-level metrics (like CPU, memory, and disk usage) from a machine for Prometheus to scrape.

### Key Features:
- **System Metrics**: Provides detailed information about the machineâ€™s performance and status.
- **Metrics Format**: Exposes metrics in a format that Prometheus can easily scrape and process.

## 4. Setting Up Prometheus

### A. Install Prometheus
1. **Download Prometheus**:
   - Visit the [Prometheus downloads page](https://prometheus.io/download/) and get the latest version:
     ```bash
     wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v<version>/prometheus-<version>.linux-amd64.tar.gz
     ```
   - Extract the tarball:
     ```bash
     tar -xvf prometheus-<version>.linux-amd64.tar.gz
     cd prometheus-<version>.linux-amd64
     ```

2. **Run Prometheus**:
   - Start Prometheus using the following command:
     ```bash
     ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
     ```

3. **Access Prometheus UI**:
   - Prometheus runs on `http://localhost:9090`. Access it via your browser to check the status.

### B. Configuring Prometheus to Scrape Node Exporter
- Add the Node Exporter to the `prometheus.yml` configuration file:
  ```yaml
  scrape_configs:
    - job_name: 'node_exporter'
      static_configs:
        - targets: ['localhost:9100']

## 5. Setting Up Node Exporter
### A. Install Node Exporter

 **1.Download Node Exporter:**
Download the latest version from the Prometheus Node Exporter page:

```bash
wget https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases/download/v<version>/node_exporter-<version>.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```
- **Extract the tarball:**

```bash
tar -xvf node_exporter-<version>.linux-amd64.tar.gz
cd node_exporter-<version>.linux-amd64
```

 **2.Run Node Exporter:**

- Start Node Exporter:

```bash
./node_exporter
```
 **3.Access Node Exporter Metrics:**

- Node Exporter runs on http://localhost:9100/metrics. Visit the URL to view the exposed metrics.

## 6. Setting Up Grafana
### A. Install Grafana
- **1. Add the Grafana APT repository (on Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y software-properties-common
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://packages.grafana.com/oss/deb stable main"
```
- **2. Install Grafana:**

- Install Grafana using the package manager:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install grafana
```
- **3. Start Grafana:**

- Start the Grafana service
```bash
sudo systemctl start grafana-server
sudo systemctl enable grafana-server
```
- **4. Access Grafana UI:**

- Open Grafana at http://localhost:3000. The default username and password are both admin.

## 7. Integrating Prometheus with Grafana

### A. Add Prometheus as a Data Source
- **1. Log into Grafana and go to Configuration -> Data Sources.**
- **2. Add Prometheus by selecting it from the list of data sources and setting the URL to http://localhost:9090.**

### B. Creating Dashboards
#### 1. Create a New Dashboard:**

- Go to Create -> Dashboard, then Add New Panel.
PromQL Queries:

#### 2. PromQL Queries:

- Write a query to visualize data. For example, to monitor CPU usage from Node Exporter:
```promql
node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}
```

#### 3. Save and Explore:
- Customize your panel to create graphs, gauges, or tables, and save the dashboard for continuous monitoring.

## 8. Setting Up Alerts in Grafana
### A. Define an Alert Rule
**1. Create an Alert:**

- Go to your dashboard panel, click on the alerting tab, and define a rule. For example, set an alert when CPU usage exceeds a threshold.

**2. Configure Notification Channels:**

- Set up channels for receiving alerts via email, Slack, or other tools.

### B. Testing Alerts
**1. Test Alert Conditions:**
- Trigger alerts based on the metrics you are monitoring, and ensure that you receive notifications as expected.

## 9. Best Practices
### A. Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Use Prometheus to scrape system metrics with Node Exporter, and visualize them in Grafana for better understanding and tracking.
### B. Define Clear Alerts
- Set up alerts for key metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and disk space to get early notifications before issues impact the system.
